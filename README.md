# **Ecommerce Payments Analysis**  
An **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** focused on **e-commerce transactions and digital payments.** This project uses **pandas-profiling (ydata-profiling)** and **Streamlit** to generate automated reports and interactive dashboards for analyzing online payment trends.

## **📌 Project Overview**
With the rapid adoption of digital payments in e-commerce, analyzing transaction patterns, and user preference across various UPI-based applications used in different countries is essential. This project focuses on collecting and analyzing data from multiple UPI payment apps worldwide, providing insights into regional payment trends, and user preferences.

### **🔹 Key Features**
- Automated **EDA using pandas-profiling (ydata-profiling)**.
- Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for data exploration.
- **Transaction insights** and correlation analysis.
- **Exportable HTML report** for detailed payment analysis.
